# Lyrics Searching App

This is basically just a React version of a vanilla JavaScript project inspired by one of Brad Traversy's tutorials. ( https://www.udemy.com/course/web-projects-with-vanilla-javascript/ ) I changed some of the styling and refactored the code into a much smaller React code base using hooks. API is the same one used for that project. Couldn't really find a better API than that one. ( https://github.com/NTag/lyrics.ovh ) or ( https://lyricsovh.docs.apiary.io/# )

### To do's

1. I have been on the lookout for an API that returns Chords to add a music learning function
2. Update styling
3. Clean up UI and make sure mobile friendly
4. Fix prev and next buttons
